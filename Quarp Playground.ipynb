    "# A practical application for Quarp\n",
    "Quarp started as a way to identify similarities between PNMs (Potential New Members) and existing members of a fraternity. In this process all PNMs must fill out a survey with their contact information and a couple questions like, \"What activities did you participate in during highschool. In this demo, we take two csv files that are the responses from 2 identical surveys, one given to PNMs and one given to existing members of a fraternity.. These csv's are converted into collections of objects that will be passed into the scoring function, they are: pnms and brother_objects. The scoring function is fairly arbitrary in this demo and not the full implementation."
